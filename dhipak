hi this is dhipak
learning git
use git config --list to see the list and 
use git clone url to copy or clone the remote repo to local to view or edit the file
use cd /repo name to list the files in repo and then
use vi file name to view or edit the file 
and then use git add file name to track the file 
and git commit -m to change from staging to local 
and then use git push -u origin branch name[main]
then the edited content will be reflected in the remote repo
